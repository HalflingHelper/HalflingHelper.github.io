## About

I am an undergraduate studying math and computer science at Indiana University
in Bloomington, IN. I am interested in programming language theory and many
other topics at the intersection of math and computing. I enjoy playing the 
violin, making crossword puzzles, and working on the digital desk for the 
Indiana Daily Student.

## Current Projects

### Deduce Proof Assistant
The Deduce proof assistant was created by Jeremy Siek to help teach ideas
about correct code in Indiana University's data structures course. You
can find the code on [github](https://github.com/jsiek/deduce) and read
more about it on the [web page](https://jsiek.github.io/deduce/).

My main contributions include support for biconditionals, improving theorem
instantiation, and an in-progress ring solver.


### Mega Puzzle
Mega Puzzle is an event that I help to run, inspired by the MIT Mystery hunt.
